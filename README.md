# ***NUS EE5907R -  Pattern Recognition Assignment***

* ## *CA1*
    ### Data Description
    The data is an email spam dataset, consisting of 4601 email messages with 57 features. Feature
    descriptions are found in this [link][https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/datasets/spam.info.txt]. 
    We have divided the data into a training set (3065 emails) and test set (1536 emails) with accompanying labels (1 = spam , 0 = not spam)
    
    ### Q1. Beta-bernoulli Naive Bayes 
    ### Q2. Gaussian Naive Bayes 
    ### Q3. Logistic regression 
    ### Q4. K-Nearest Neighbors 
    ### Q5. Survey 
    
* ## *CA2*
     ### Data Description
      The project will be conducted on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains in total 70,000 handwritten digit images, which are divided into a training set of 60; 000 examples,
      and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixedsize image. The raw data and labels can be downloaded from [http://yann.lecun.com/
      exdb/mnist/.][http://yann.lecun.com/]
      
     ### Q1. PCA for Feature Extraction, Visualization and Classification
     ### Q2. LDA for Feature Extraction and Classification
     ### Q3. SVM for Classification 
     ### Q4. Neural Networks
